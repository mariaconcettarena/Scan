# Scan: Document Scanner iOS Application

Welcome to Scan, your go-to iOS application for quickly and efficiently scanning documents on the go!

## Features
#### *Efficient Scanning*
Instantly capture high-quality scans using your device.
#### *Document Enhancement*
Improve scan quality with built-in enhancement features.
#### *Automatic Edge Detection*
No need to manually crop scans - Scan automatically detects document edges.

## Installation
Scan is available for iOS devices running iOS 12.0 and above. You can download it from this repository.

## How to Use
Open Scan on your iOS device. Place the document you want to scan within the camera frame and tap the capture button.

## Accessibility
Scan is designed with accessibility in mind and works seamlessly with VoiceOver, Apple's screen reader technology. I believe everyone should have equal access to our app, regardless of their abilities. With VoiceOver, users with visual impairments can navigate Scan's interface and capture documents.
